                        Hey there, I'm Aditya Jaiswal, a student at Scaler
                        School of Technology. I really love learning about
                        techâ€”it's my thing. Besides that, I'm big on staying
                        healthy and fit. I hit the gym every day to keep my mind
                        and body in top shape.
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        When I'm not working out or studying, I enjoy reading
                        books. I'm into all sorts of stuff, like philosophy,
                        self-help, and finance. Learning about money matters is
                        pretty interesting to me. Oh, and I'm also a big fan of
                        movies. Whether it's a deep drama or a funny comedy, I'm
                        always down for a good flick.
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        So, yeah, I guess you could say I'm all about tech,
                        staying fit, reading, and catching movies whenever I
                        can.
                        <br></br>
